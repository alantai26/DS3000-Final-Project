        "Stock market volatility varies across different sectors of the economy. Technology stocks are typically considered more volatile than utility stocks, but can this be shown through data? Being able to understand these volatility patterns across sectors can help investors make more informed decisions about their portfolio and how they manage risk.\n",

        "1. \"Which sectors exhibit the highest volatility\"? This could help investors decide the risk to reward ratio in each sector.\n",
        "2. \"Can we predict a stock's sector based on its volume and price volatility\"? This could help investors understand if volatility and volume patterns are specific to certain sectors, which could be useful to identify trends in different sectors.\n",
